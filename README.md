# fay-base

[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

This package exports Prelude, FFI and other modules which you probably want to use with [Fay](http://www.fay-lang.org).

Anything essential for using the compiler, or modules exported by GHC's base can go in this package.

The major version number is coupled with Fay itself, so fay 0.18.* should be used with fay-base 0.18.*.
